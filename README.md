# Chat-application
A simple chat program using socket programming
The simple chat application between the client and the server is implemented using socket interface. 
Each protocol provides certain services and the APIs provides syntax through which those services can be invoked. 
The key is to map the operations and the objects defined by the APIs to the services provided by the protocol. If the interfaces are defined properly then its easy for the developer to use the syntax to invoke the services provided by different protocol. In simple terms, socket is defined as the point where the local application process connects to the network. The entire process revolves around the socket. To create an application, one must create a socket, attach the socket to the network, send and receive the messages through the socket and finally close the socket
